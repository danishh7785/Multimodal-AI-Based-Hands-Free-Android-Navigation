# 🔧 Quick Fix Summary - Screenshot & Go Back

## ✅ FIXED AND BUILT SUCCESSFULLY

### 🐛 Problems:
- ❌ Screenshot not working
- ❌ Go back not working

### ✅ Root Causes Found:
1. No accessibility service check
2. No user feedback (silent failures)
3. Missing screenshot capability in config
4. No error handling

### 🔧 Solutions Applied:

#### 1. Added Service Validation
```kotlin
val service = GazeAccessibilityService.getInstance()
if (service == null) {
    showToast("Enable Accessibility Service first")
    return
}
```

#### 2. Added Toast Feedback
- "Taking Screenshot" ✓
- "Going Back" ✓
- "Enable Accessibility Service first" ⚠️

#### 3. Updated accessibility_service_config.xml
```xml
android:canPerformGestures="true"
android:canTakeScreenshot="true"
```

#### 4. Enhanced Logging
```kotlin
Log.d(TAG, "Screenshot taken, result: $result")
Log.d(TAG, "performBack result: $result")
```
