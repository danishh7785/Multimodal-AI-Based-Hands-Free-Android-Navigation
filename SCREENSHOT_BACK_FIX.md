2. **No User Feedback** - Silent failures with no error messages
3. **Limited Logging** - Couldn't debug what went wrong
4. **Missing Config** - Accessibility service didn't have screenshot capability enabled

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced takeScreenshot() Method
**Before**:
```kotlin
private fun takeScreenshot() {
    GazeAccessibilityService.takeScreenshot()
    Log.d(TAG, "Screenshot command sent")
}
```

**After**:
```kotlin
private fun takeScreenshot() {
    try {
        Log.d(TAG, "Attempting to take screenshot")
        val service = GazeAccessibilityService.getInstance()
        
        if (service == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Accessibility service not running")
            showToast("Enable Accessibility Service first")
            return
        }
        
        if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {
            GazeAccessibilityService.takeScreenshot()
            Log.d(TAG, "Screenshot command sent successfully")
            showToast("Taking Screenshot")
        } else {
            Log.e(TAG, "Screenshot requires Android 9+")
            showToast("Screenshot requires Android 9 or higher")
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Error taking screenshot: ${e.message}", e)
        showToast("Screenshot failed: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced goBack() Method
**Before**:
```kotlin
private fun goBack() {
    GazeAccessibilityService.performBack()
    Log.d(TAG, "Back navigation triggered")
}
```

**After**:
```kotlin
private fun goBack() {
    try {
        Log.d(TAG, "Attempting to go back")
        val service = GazeAccessibilityService.getInstance()
        
        if (service == null) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Accessibility service not running")
            showToast("Enable Accessibility Service first")
            return
        }
        
        GazeAccessibilityService.performBack()
        Log.d(TAG, "Back navigation triggered successfully")
        showToast("Going Back")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Error going back: ${e.message}", e)
        showToast("Back navigation failed: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

### 3. Updated Accessibility Service Config
**Added** in `accessibility_service_config.xml`:
```xml
android:canPerformGestures="true"
android:canTakeScreenshot="true"
```

These capabilities are **REQUIRED** for:
- `canTakeScreenshot="true"` → Allows taking screenshots
- `canPerformGestures="true"` → Allows simulating user gestures

### 4. Enhanced GazeAccessibilityService Logging
**Before**:
```kotlin
fun performBack() {
    instance?.performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK)
}
```

**After**:
```kotlin
fun performBack() {
    val result = instance?.performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK) ?: false
    Log.d("GazeAccessibility", "performBack result: $result")
}
```

### 5. Improved Screenshot Logging in Service
```kotlin
private fun performScreenshot() {
    try {
        if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.P) {
            val result = performGlobalAction(GLOBAL_ACTION_TAKE_SCREENSHOT)
            Log.d("GazeAccessibility", "Screenshot taken, result: $result")
            if (!result) {
                Log.e("GazeAccessibility", "Screenshot action failed - check permissions")
            }
        } else {
            Log.e("GazeAccessibility", "Screenshot requires Android 9+, current: ${SDK_INT}")
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("GazeAccessibility", "Error taking screenshot: ${e.message}", e)
    }
}
```

## ⚙️ Prerequisites for Features to Work

### CRITICAL: Enable Accessibility Service
Both screenshot and go back features **REQUIRE** accessibility service to be enabled.

**How to Enable**:
1. Open device **Settings**
2. Go to **Accessibility**
3. Find **Face Mesh App** (or "Gaze Accessibility Service")
4. Toggle it **ON**
5. Confirm permission dialog

**Check if Enabled**:
```bash
# Via ADB
adb shell settings get secure enabled_accessibility_services
```

Should show: `com.example.face_mesh_app/.GazeAccessibilityService`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "Enable Accessibility Service first" Message

**Cause**: Accessibility service is not enabled in device settings

**Solution**:
```
1. Settings → Accessibility
2. Find "Face Mesh App" or "Gaze Accessibility Service"
3. Toggle ON
4. Accept permission prompt
5. Retry command
```

**Verify via ADB**:
```powershell
adb shell settings get secure enabled_accessibility_services
```

### Issue 2: "Screenshot requires Android 9 or higher"

**Cause**: Device is running Android 8 or lower

**Solution**:
- Screenshot feature requires Android 9 (API 28) or higher
- Check device version: Settings → About Phone → Android Version
- If < 9, feature cannot work (system limitation)

**Check via ADB**:
```powershell
adb shell getprop ro.build.version.sdk
```
Result should be ≥ 28

### Issue 3: Screenshot Toast Shows But No Image Saved

**Possible Causes**:
1. Permission denied
2. Storage full
3. Manufacturer restriction

**Debug Steps**:
```powershell
# Check logs for errors
adb logcat | Select-String "GazeAccessibility"

# Check if screenshot action returned true
# Should see: "Screenshot taken, result: true"

# Check storage
adb shell df /sdcard

# Try manual screenshot
adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/test_screenshot.png
```

### Issue 4: Go Back Works Sometimes, Not Always

**Possible Causes**:
1. Some screens don't respond to back action
2. App intercepts back button
3. In home screen (no back action available)

**Debug**:
```powershell
# Check logs for result
adb logcat | Select-String "performBack"

# Should see: "performBack result: true"
# If false, the action wasn't accepted by current screen
```

### Issue 5: Service Keeps Disconnecting

**Possible Causes**:
1. Device battery optimization
2. Memory pressure
3. System killing service

**Solution**:
```
1. Settings → Apps → Face Mesh App
2. Battery → Unrestricted
3. Permissions → All granted
4. Disable battery optimization for this app
```
