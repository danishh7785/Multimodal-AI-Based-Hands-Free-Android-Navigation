# Build Status Report

## ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Build Type**: Debug  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED  
**Build Time**: 5 seconds  

---

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ Critical Error (FIXED)
**Error**: Protected Permission - INJECT_EVENTS
```
C:\...\AndroidManifest.xml:12: Error: Permission is only granted to system apps
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INJECT_EVENTS" />
```

**Solution**: Removed the `INJECT_EVENTS` permission from AndroidManifest.xml
- This permission is only available to system apps
- Not needed for the voice commands feature
- Accessibility service provides all needed functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `AndroidManifest.xml` - Removed INJECT_EVENTS permission line

---

### ⚠️ Warning (FIXED)
**Warning**: Unused variable 'voiceEnabled'
```
MainActivity.kt:116: Variable 'voiceEnabled' is never used
```

**Solution**: Removed unused variable declaration
- Code was reading preference but not using it
- Simplified the preference loading code

**Files Modified**:
- `MainActivity.kt` - Removed unused variable

---

### ⚠️ Warning (FIXED)
**Warning**: Condition always true
```
GazeAccessibilityService.kt:125: Condition 'currentNode != null' is always 'true'
```

**Solution**: Changed variable type to nullable
- Changed `var currentNode = node` to `var currentNode: AccessibilityNodeInfo? = node`
- This properly reflects that parent can be null

**Files Modified**:
- `GazeAccessibilityService.kt` - Made currentNode nullable

---

## Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

These are deprecation warnings that don't affect functionality:

### 1. Deprecated API Usage
```
'startActivityForResult(Intent, Int): Unit' is deprecated
Location: MainActivity.kt:223
```
**Status**: ⚠️ Minor - Works fine, but could be updated later
**Note**: Google recommends using ActivityResultContracts API instead

### 2. Deprecated CameraX API
```
'setTargetAspectRatio(Int): ImageAnalysis.Builder' is deprecated
Location: MainActivity.kt:443
```
**Status**: ⚠️ Minor - Works fine, still supported
**Note**: CameraX has newer APIs but old ones still work

### 3. Unused Parameters
```
Parameter 'frameWidth' is never used (MainActivity.kt:592)
Parameter 'frameHeight' is never used (MainActivity.kt:592)
```
**Status**: ⚠️ Minor - Parameters present for future use
**Note**: These are in the head movement detection method, may be used later

### 4. Deprecated Lifecycle API
```
'markState(Lifecycle.State): Unit' is deprecated
Location: GazeOverlayService.kt
```
**Status**: ⚠️ Minor - Works fine, alternative available
**Note**: Should use `currentState` property instead
